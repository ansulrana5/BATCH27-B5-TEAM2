The earliest university in the world was established in Bihar. The name Bihar is a derivative from Vihara, which means ‘monastery’. True to its name and its rich cultural heritage, the state houses various monasteries and it is famous for monuments belonging to various religions. The major empires of India rose to great heights here and they succumbed here as well. River Ganga enriches the plains of the landlocked state and contributes to the fertility of lands along with rivers Kosi and Gandak.",
